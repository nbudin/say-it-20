All content is Copyright ©2007 Justin Winslow/Straight Ahead Media.  This design package is free to use as long as my name and a link to backandforthblog.com remain somewhere on the blog (right now its unobtrusively placed in the footer).  If you want to use the theme without linking back to me you can contact me from our contact page at straightaheadmedia.com to inquire how to do this legally.


The calendar can easily be turned off by going into the the sidebar.php file and removing this: 

<?php get_calendar(); ?> 


If you do not wish to have the newest post indicator you can go into style.css and remove this chunk of code:

.post_firstpost {
	border:1px dotted #999999;
	background-image:url(images/newest.png);
	background-position:top right;
	background-repeat:no-repeat;
	margin: 0 0 0 -10px;
	padding: 5px 0 0 10px;
}


You can change the default color of your blog by editing the style.css file.  I laid out the things you will need to change at the top of the document so you know exactly where it is.  You can also change the selectable colors by editing the color#.css files basically the same way you edited the default color.

I hope many of you who download this theme choose to use it for your blog and if you ever need any help feel free to send me a message from the SAMedia contact form at http://straightaheadmedia.com/contact.php.


Enjoy!
